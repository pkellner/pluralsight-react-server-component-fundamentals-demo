          Our events are technical conferences in Silicon Valley where
          developers learn from developers focusing on open source, the latest
          enterprise-focused technologies, software branding, legal issues
          around software as well as other topics developers are interested in
          hearing about such as career building and other topics of interest.
          Lately, we have also added Silicon Valley Code Campfire events as
          something we now do online.
